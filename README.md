# quantum-channel-approximation
Python code for simulating quantum channels using quantum computers.

The required python packages can be installed with the requirements.txt file (note the specific numpy version).
To install all packages at once you can use
> python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

I did this in a virtual environment.

To run the files in the results folder you first have to pip install my code,
(this is done via the .toml file, I recommend using the flag -e so you 
don't have to reinstall after making changes to the library everytime)
> python -m pip install -e .

The results folder has some notebooks where you can see some examples of how the code can be used
to approximate quantum channels.
